# Furniture-store
Hi there! 
So, I’m learning Python and starting to give my first steps at this language. 
I’m going to start by presenting you a few simple things that this language can do for us.
As an example, I’m going to use a fiction dataset about a furniture store and their stock.
I’m going to star be doing some simple things and then, get a little more difficult as we’re going along this journey. 
Our dataset will have a few items and what we want to do is things like:

	Simple Variables
  
    o	Create a program that asks the user for the price of 5 pieces of furniture and calculates the total value of these items. Use a loop to handle data input. 

	
print(f"Furniture: {furniture}, Price €{price}, Stock: {stock}")

	Variable Type
  
    o	Ask the user for the name of a piece of furniture, its price, and the quantity in stock using input. Identify the data type for each variable.

	Simple Conditional
  
    o	Ask the user if they want to buy a piece of furniture. If they answer "yes," display a message saying that the furniture has been reserved; otherwise, inform them that it remains available.

	Compound Conditional
  
    o	Ask the user for the price of a piece of furniture. If the price is greater than 1.000,00€, display "Premium product"; if it is less than or equal to 500,00€, display "Economical product". For other cases, display "Intermediate product".

	Loop with Counter
  
    o	Display a 5-second countdown to announce a discount on furniture

	Loop with User Input
    
    o	Create a program that allows the user to add furniture to a shopping cart. The program should stop asking for inputs when the user types "exit."

	List Comprehension
    
    o	Suppose the store has a list of furniture prices. Create a new list with prices discounted by 10% using list comprehension.

	Slice
    
    o	Consider a list of furniture on sale: ["Sofa", "Sideboard", "Chair", "Rack", "Bed"]. Show the first 3 and the last 2 items of the list.

	Loop with Conditional
    
    o	Given a list of furniture prices, display only the prices that are greater than a specified value. Example: prices = [1200, 850, 300, 500, 1500].

	Challenge: Sum of Values
    
    o	Create a program that asks the user for the price of 5 pieces of furniture and calculates the total value of these items. Use a loop to handle data input.
